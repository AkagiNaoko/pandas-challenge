# PyCity Schools Analysis

The analysis focused on math and reading scores of students, as well as information on the schools'budgets they attend. The goal of this analysis was to identify trends in school performance that can be used to make data-driven decisions and allocate future budgets to improve student performance.

After conducting the analysis, two key conclusions were drawn:

1. Per student buget
   Schools with higher per-student budgets, did not tend to have better math and reading scores. On the contrast schools with higher budgets tend to have underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

2. School size
   Students who attend schools with lower student-to-teacher ratios tend to have better math and reading scores(89-91% passing vs 67%).The analysis also revealed a strong correlation between school scale and math/reading scores. Students who attend schools with smaller size tend to receive more individualized attention, which leads to better academic outcomes.

3. School type
   As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. 
   
   
   
In conclusion, the analysis of the standardized test results reveals that investments in higher per-student budgets and lower student-to-teacher ratios can lead to better academic outcomes for students. The insights provided by this analysis can be used by the school board and mayor to allocate budgets and prioritize initiatives that will ultimately benefit the students and the community as a whole.
